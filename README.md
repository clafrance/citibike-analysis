Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard/story which will provide the following information:

* Number of trips that have been recorded total between 2016 and 2018

* The effectiveness has gender outreach between 2016 and 2018

* How does the average trip duration change by age between 2016 and 2018

* The average distance in miles that a bike is ridden in 2018

* Percentage of the total ridership growth 

* Change of proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers

* Peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months

* Peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months

* Predit the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey for today 

* Predit the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey for today 

* Predit the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey for today 

* Predit the the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey for today  

* Predit the the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female) for today 

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in 2018? 

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
